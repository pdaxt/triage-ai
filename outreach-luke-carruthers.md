## Message (LinkedIn InMail / Connection Request)

Hi Luke,

I noticed DeVision is recruiting a technical cofounder for a med-tech AI triage platform. I've already built one.

**TriageAI** - live demo: https://triage-ai-bay.vercel.app

What it does:
- AI-powered symptom collection via conversational interface
- Australian Triage Scale (ATS) classification (Cat 1-5)
- 4-layer safety architecture with red flag detection
- Production-ready: React + Node.js + Claude API on Vercel

I spent the last week building this to prove I could execute. Now I'm looking for the right business partner—someone who's done $100M+ exits and knows how to navigate healthcare commercialization.

If the role you're hiring for is yours (or even if it's not), I'd be interested in exploring a partnership where:
- **You:** Business strategy, healthcare relationships, fundraising
- **Me:** Technical execution, AI/ML, product development

I'm based in Sydney and can meet in person.

Happy to walk you through the codebase and architecture. The repo is public: https://github.com/pdaxt/triage-ai

Cheers,
Pranjal Gupta

## Shorter Version (Connection Request Note - 300 char limit)

Hi Luke - I saw the med-tech cofounder role via DeVision. I've already built an AI triage platform (live demo: triage-ai-bay.vercel.app). Looking for a business cofounder with your exit track record. Interested in chatting?

## Follow-up (If No Response After 5 Days)

Hi Luke,

Following up on my message about TriageAI. I've since added:
- Supabase integration for conversation persistence
- Rate limiting with Upstash Redis
- Comprehensive safety layer with clinical rules

The demo is solid. If you're still looking for technical execution capability for a med-tech venture, I'd welcome 15 minutes to discuss.

Pranjal
