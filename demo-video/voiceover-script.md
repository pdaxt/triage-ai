## SCRIPT

### INTRO (0-10s)
"TriageAI. AI-powered patient triage for Australian healthcare."

### THE PROBLEM (10-25s)
"Australian emergency departments handle 8.9 million presentations each year. 30% are non-urgent. Triage nurses are overwhelmed, and telehealth lacks standardized pre-screening."

### THE SOLUTION (25-40s)
"TriageAI implements the official Australian Triage Scale with a 4-layer safety architecture. Deterministic guardrails catch red flags in under 1 millisecond. The LLM can never under-triage a critical patient."

### DEMO: EMERGENCY SCENARIO (40-65s)
"Watch what happens when a patient reports chest pain radiating to their left arm."

*[Show chat interaction]*

"The system immediately detects the cardiac red flag, assigns ATS Category 2, and recommends urgent assessment within 10 minutes. All in real-time."

### DEMO: SAFE SCENARIO (65-80s)
"For a mild headache without red flags, the AI asks clarifying questions and appropriately triages as non-urgent, ATS Category 5."

### CLOSE (80-90s)
"TriageAI. Safe, explainable, production-ready. Built with React, Node.js, and AWS. Let's build the future of healthcare AI together."
