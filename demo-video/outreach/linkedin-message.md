Hi Will,

I saw the Technical Co-founder role for the AI med-tech startup. Instead of a CV, I built the product.

**Demo video:** [PASTE_YOUTUBE_LINK]
**GitHub:** https://github.com/pdaxt/triage-ai

Australian Triage Scale. 4-layer safety architecture. Red flag detection in <1ms.

Happy to chat with the founder.

## Longer Version (for email or follow-up)

Hi Will,

I came across the Technical Co-founder role you're recruiting for — the AI-powered patient triage platform in St Leonards.

Rather than sending a CV, I built a working demo.

**What I built in 48 hours:**
- Full Australian Triage Scale (ATS) implementation
- 4-layer safety architecture (deterministic guardrails + LLM reasoning)
- Red flag detection in <1ms (chest pain, stroke symptoms, etc.)
- React + Node.js + Express (per the job spec)
- 12/12 automated tests passing

**Links:**
- Demo video: [PASTE_YOUTUBE_LINK]
- Live demo: [PASTE_VERCEL_URL if deployed]
- GitHub: https://github.com/pdaxt/triage-ai

The system implements the same clinical discriminators used in Australian EDs, with deterministic guardrails that ensure the LLM can never under-triage a critical patient.

I'd love to connect with the founder to discuss the vision. I'm based in Sydney and ready to start immediately.

Best,
Pranjal Gupta
